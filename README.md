# UWMockData
Fictional mock student data

## Introduction

Collabrative project to generate fictional data. To be implemented in Stata, R, and Python.

## The Case for Fictional Data

Fictional data is useful for:

* **Testing purposes** - the availability of fictional data can reduce he need for accessing archive or production data. Conducting tests with production tends is not a best practice because it is usually not reliable and typically incapable of supporting a replication. In adition to the drawbacks associated with production data, both production and archive data often contain individual identifies. Even when de-identified, the risk of inadvertently exposing private information disfavors use of production or archive data during testing.
* **Educational purposes** - the same reasons discussed above that favor using fictional data for testing also favors using fictional data for educational purposes. Students can use fictional data to learn, test, or develop new methods and concepts. When there are questions, students can reporduce their work for other students, mentors, teachers, or others. Additionally, using fictional data avoids the risk of inadvertently re-identifying data that had prevously been de-identified.

The risk of re-identification is never zero, 68th Governor of Massachusetts Bill Weld:

> Professor Latanya Sweeney, director of the Data Privacy Lab at Harvard, along with her research assistant and two students scraped data on 1,130 people of the now more than 2,500 who have shared their DNA data for the Personal Genome Project. ... She was also able to identify then Massachusetts Gov. William Weld from anonymous hospital discharge records.
